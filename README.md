# CancerType_Update

## Project Overview
This repository is part of a collaborative initiative to update the "cancerother" column in our biopharma RUO/IST data, which has been extracted from the data warehouse. The primary goal is to ensure that all missing values (NaNs) in the "cancerother" column are accurately filled. This effort is critical to enhance the integrity and utility of our datasets for ongoing and future analyses.

## Getting Started

### Repository Structure
- `df_merged.csv`: The main CSV file containing the dataset with missing values in the "cancerother" column.
- `Data_Extraction.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook explaining how the data was pulled from the data warehouse.
